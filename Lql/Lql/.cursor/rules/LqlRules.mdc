- Split db specific logic out from shared code
- Code reuse is critical! Push most code down to shared code rather than db specific code
- Do not use Regex to parse!! FIX the Antlr grammar! If Antlr can't handle the syntax we want, try changing syntax to achieve something similar
- Model the Select statements as algebraic data types. Use composition to model the differences between db platforms. Don't use OOP inheritance. 
- Don't ignore linter errors
- Immutabilty and FP style everyhere (no classes)
