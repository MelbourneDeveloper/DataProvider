/// This demonstrates how the type provider should work with compile-time safety
/// The type provider connects to the database at compile time and generates
/// strongly-typed interfaces for all tables and columns

// This would generate types at compile time based on the actual database schema
// type DB = LqlDatabase<"Data Source=invoices.db">

/// Example of what the generated types would look like:
/// 
/// DB.Tables.Customer would have properties:
///   - Id: int64
///   - CustomerName: string  
///   - Email: string option
///   - Phone: string option
///   - CreatedDate: string
///
/// DB.Tables.Invoice would have properties:
///   - Id: int64
///   - InvoiceNumber: string
///   - InvoiceDate: string
///   - CustomerName: string
///   - etc...

    // With a real type provider, this would give you:
    // 1. IntelliSense on all table and column names
    // 2. Compile-time errors if you reference non-existent columns
    // 3. Proper type checking (no casting needed)

    This is what the usage would look like with a proper type provider:
    
    let db = DB()
    
    // IntelliSense would show all available tables
    let customers = db.Tables.Customer.SelectAll()
    
    // IntelliSense would show all available columns for Customer
    let customerNames = customers |> List.map (fun c -> c.CustomerName)
    
    // This would give a compile-time ERROR if "NonExistentColumn" doesn't exist:
    // let badQuery = customers |> List.map (fun c -> c.NonExistentColumn)
    
    // Type-safe LQL queries:
    let query = 
        lql {
            from Customer
            where (fun c -> c.CustomerName.Contains("Corp"))
            select (fun c -> {| Name = c.CustomerName; Email = c.Email |})
        }
    
    let results = db.Execute(query)
    *)
